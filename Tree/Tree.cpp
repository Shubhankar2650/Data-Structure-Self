     #Ô∏è‚É£    *** TREE ***

     A tree is a non-linear data structure used to represent hierarchical data in the graphical form
    It hierarchly consisting the nodes such that each node consists a value and a list of references to the 
    other node.
    e.g organization structre, folder structre

    it stores data in hierarchical fashion and ordering of nodes is not required
    

    Important terminalogy in tree- 
    1. node - 
    2. root - top of hierarchy 
    3. leaf - bottom of hierarchy 
    4. child 
    5. parent 
    6. subtree  - Tree data is resurcsive in nature and  contains many tree within itself known as sub-tree
    7. desendent - desendant of a node are all the nodes that lies as subtree with this node as a parent node
    7. ancestors 
    8. degree - no of childereen a node have is called degree
    9. internal nodes - which donot degree zero


    üëå Application of tree
    1. Hierarchical data - Organization Structure 
                         - Folder Structrre
                         - XML/ HTML Content (json objects) 
                         - In OOPs(Inheritance)
    2. Binary Search Tree
    3. Binary Heap (mainly use to represent priority queues which use in many algorithms)
    4. B and B+ Tree in DBMS(Whenever we need indexing we use B or B+ for that purpose otherwise hashing) 
    5. Spanning and Shortest Path tree in computer networks
        (In bridges we use spanning tree and in routers we use shortest path tree)
    6. Parsing tree, Expression tree in compiler

    7. Trie ( use for represent dictonary, also support opertions like prfix search)
    8. Suffix Tree ( use to do fast searches in text in string(here time taken for searching pattern is proportional to the lenght of the pattern ))
    9. Binary Index Tree  (use for range query searches) 
    10. segment tree  (use for range query searches just more powerfull than BIT)


    üëâ Tree traversal techniques
    Breadth first Search (or level Order)
    Depth first search - 
        Inorder - left root right
        Pre order- root left right
        Post Order- left right root
        // Time complexity - O(n);
        Auxilary Space - O(h) (height of tree) in case of binary tree
